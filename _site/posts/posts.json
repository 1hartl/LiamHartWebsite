I present data on how belief change may influence the components included in an argumentative essay.\nAbstract\nBelievers and disbelievers in gun control effectiveness wrote a 250 word essay explaining their beliefs after reading a one-sided text that was either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Essays were coded for number of reasons and the presence or absence of a claim, counterargument, text content, policy claim, metacognitive statement, and evaluative statement about the text. Between group differences in essay characteristics and how they relate as a function of belief change are discussed.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI gave a talk at the 25th annual Student Scholars Day at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan. I present preliminary evidence on an ongoing study that found a significant decrease in ageism in college students following a lecture-based psychology course on aging that included a service-learning project.\nAbstract\nAgeism, or prejudicial attitudes about individuals based on age, is pervasive in society. Theories such as terror management theory, social identity theory, and stereotype embodiment theory have been used to explain what may give rise to ageism. Research also suggests that education about aging and reciprocal intergenerational interactions can reduce ageism and a combination of these two could be most effective. The present study investigated whether college studentâ€™s perception of old age can be influenced by taking a psychology class on aging, a lecture and discussion-based course with a project that requires students to participate in activities with residents at a local retirement home. The Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) was administered to the students at the beginning and end of the course. The results showed a significant reduction in the overall score and two out of three subscales of FSA (stereotype and separation but not affective attitudes).\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI gave a talk at the 15th annual Art & Sciences of Aging (2020). I propose a study to examine the effect of mindfulness meditation on the life satisfaction and self-esteem of retirement home resident. Unfortunately, this study never saw the light of day. Just a few days before I began to collect data for this study, the COVID-19 pandemic had put an end to in-person research for the foreseeable future.\nAbstract\nMindfulness can be used to describe a variety of practices and processes that generally involves focusing on the present moment and being conscious and aware. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression, so it is likely that it will increase life satisfaction and self-esteem. In this poster, I will propose a study that seeks to determine the effect of mindfulness meditation on life satisfaction and self-esteem in older adults living in retirement homes. Participants will undergo an 8-week mindfulness meditation intervention, following a 10-minute guided meditation 4 times per week and will be encouraged to practice daily. Life satisfaction and self-esteem will be measured before and after the 8-week mindfulness meditation.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
