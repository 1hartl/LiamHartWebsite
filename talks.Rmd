### Research, Student Scholarship and Beyond: My Academic Journey

#### April 12, 2023 / 32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse / [Slides](documents/SSD_2023.pptx)

Hart, L. (2023) Research, Student Scholarship and Beyond: My Academic Journey. Oral presentation at the 27th Grand Valley State University Student Scholar's Day, Allendale, MI

#### Abstract

As a recent graduate with a bachelor's in psychology and applied statistics, Liam will provide an overview of his academic research and reflect on its value for graduate school applications. In his freshman year, Liam began research in an exercise science lab before declaring psychology as a major. In his senior year (2022), Liam was awarded the “Excellence in a Discipline” and the “Robert Hendersen Leadership” awards. Since then, he has engaged in two separate lines of research in social and cognitive psychology which have led to peer-reviewed publications and several manuscripts in progress. As an integral part of his academic journey, Liam will reflect on his participation in the Student Summer Scholars program and discuss the benefits of such programs offered by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (OURS). Liam will discuss the importance of faculty mentorship and how active involvement in a research lab has helped prepare him for graduate school and a career in research.

### Beliefs Influence Argumentative Writing

#### July 7, 2022 / 32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse / [Slides](documents/STD_2022.pptx)

Hart, L., Russel, G., Wolfe, M., & Williams, T. (2022) Belief Change After Reading Predicts Argumentative Essay Content. Paper presented at the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse, virtual.

#### Abstract

Believers and disbelievers in gun control effectiveness wrote a 250 word essay explaining their beliefs after reading a one-sided text that was either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Essays were coded for number of reasons and the presence or absence of a claim, counterargument, text content, policy claim, metacognitive statement, and evaluative statement about the text. Between group differences in essay characteristics and how they relate as a function of belief change are discussed.

### Information about Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs

#### April 14, 2022 / Student Summer Scholars Showcase / [Slides](documents/SSD_2022.pptx)

Hart, L. Russel, G. (2022) Information about Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs. Paper presented at the 26th Annual Grand Valley State University Student Scholars Day, Allendale, MI.

#### Abstract

This experiment investigates the influence that information concerning past beliefs has on current beliefs. Participants in the experiment were either believers or disbelievers in the effectiveness of gun control, according to responses on a pre-screening survey. In the study, participants read a text that was either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Next, they verified initial beliefs on gun control from the pre-screen survey that were either accurate, the opposite of their initial beliefs, or they did not verify gun control beliefs. Finally, participants reported their current beliefs and wrote a 250-word essay explaining their beliefs. Verifying true initial beliefs resulted in less belief change. These results support the hypothesis that beliefs are subject to the influence of salient information in the recall context.

### Information about Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs

Hart, L. (2021) Information about Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs. Paper presented at the Grand Valley State University Student Summer Scholars Showcase, Allendale, MI.

#### Abstract

This experiment investigated the influence that information concerning past beliefs has on current beliefs. Participants for this experiment were selected on the basis of being strongly in favor or opposed to gun control, according to responses in a pre-screening session. In the study, participants read a text that was consistent or inconsistent with those beliefs. Next, they verified initial beliefs about gun control that were either accurate, the opposite of their actual beliefs (misinformation), or they did not verify gun control beliefs. Participants then reported their beliefs again and wrote approximately 250 words explaining the rationale for their belief. Using a mixed-model, we found that verifying true information about previous beliefs resulted in reduced belief change compared to the other information conditions. These preliminary results partially support the hypothesis that beliefs may be influenced by salient information that is available in the recall context.

### Can Ageism Be Reduced by Service Learning Built in a Lecture-Based Aging Course?

#### April 13, 2021 / 25th Grand Valley State University Student Scholars Day / [Slides](documents/SSD_2021.pptx)

Hart, L. (2021) Can Ageism Be Reduced by Service Learning Built in a Lecture-Based Aging Course? Paper presented at the 25th Grand Valley State University Student Scholars Day, virtual.

#### Abstract

Ageism, or prejudicial attitudes about individuals based on age, is pervasive in society. Theories such as terror management theory, social identity theory, and stereotype embodiment theory have been used to explain what may give rise to ageism. Research also suggests that education about aging and reciprocal intergenerational interactions can reduce ageism and a combination of these two could be most effective. The present study investigated whether college student’s perception of old age can be influenced by taking a psychology class on aging, a lecture and discussion-based course with a project that requires students to participate in activities with residents at a local retirement home. The Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) was administered to the students at the beginning and end of the course. The results showed a significant reduction in the overall score and two out of three subscales of FSA (stereotype and separation but not affective attitudes).

### Effect of Mindfulness Meditation on Life Satisfaction and Self-Esteem in Retirement Home Residents: Proposed Study

#### February 26, 2020 / 15th Art and Science of Aging Conference / [Slides](documents/MeditationPresentationAASA2020.pptx)

Hart, L. (2020) Effect of Mindfulness on Life Satisfaction and Self-Esteem in Retirement Home Residents. Study proposal presented at the 15th Art and Science of Aging Conference, Grand Rapids, MI

#### Abstract

Mindfulness can be used to describe a variety of practices and processes that generally involves focusing on the present moment and being conscious and aware. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression, so it is likely that it will increase life satisfaction and self-esteem. In this poster, I will propose a study that seeks to determine the effect of mindfulness meditation on life satisfaction and self-esteem in older adults living in retirement homes. Participants will undergo an 8-week mindfulness meditation intervention, following a 10-minute guided meditation 4 times per week and will be encouraged to practice daily. Life satisfaction and self-esteem will be measured before and after the 8-week mindfulness meditation.

*Note.* Unfortunately, this study never saw the light of day. Just a few days before I began to collect data for this study, the COVID-19 pandemic had put an end to in-person research for the foreseeable future.
